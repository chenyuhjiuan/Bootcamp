I earned my Nursing BS degree in Taiwan. After graduating from college, I practiced medical nursing in several hospitals and taught nursing in several high schools and colleges.  In pursuit of higher education, I enrolled at Howard University to study genetics and received a master's degree in human genetics in 1998. I have been a research associate for several years at Howard University Hospital.
Believing that my reasoning ability is good, I started to learn information-related skills in 2010. So far the skills I have learned are Java, Servlet, JSP, PHP, Python Django, PHP, JavaScript, Angular, HTML, CSS, Oracle Virtualbox, Linux OP, and cybersecurity.  I am a certified Java 6 programmer and CompTIA Security + specialist. Owing to the above skills, I am looking for an entry-level position either in Java web development or cybersecurity analysis.
